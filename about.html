					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>Our fresh pizzas, hearty pasta dishes, and succulent
						desserts are sure to please. And don't forget about our
						daily chalkboard specials!</p>
					<p>Spaghetti and Cruft opened our doors in 1999, bringing great pizza and
						pasta to the heart of the city's trendy Riverbend district. We handcraft
						our pizzas on the spot using only the best ingredients, and then we bake them to
						perfection in our rustic wood-fired brick oven. We sell pizza by the slice
						or by the pie and even offer catering for any occasion all around the
						neighborhood.</p>
					<p>Our broad menu of pasta dishes puts a modern twist on Old Italia, served
						in heaping bowlfuls sure to satisfy any appetite (though we bet you'll want
						seconds anyway). But it's not all noodles and crust at Spaghetti and Cruft;
						we also have fresh veggie sides, an all-you-can-eat salad bar, and the best
						cannolis in town!</p>
					<p>Spaghetti and Cruft offers free wireless broadband internet access so
						laptop-toting patrons can check their e-mail, publish updates to their
						<dfn title="short for weblog, a kind of online journal">blogs</dfn>, or
						even do some honest work.</p>
					<p>We accept all major credit cards, as well as
						<abbr title="Automatic Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> cards
						(you'll need to provide your
						<acronym title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</acronym>).</p>
